<a name="Childhood_and_youth"></a><h2> Childhood and youth </h2>
<p>Turing was conceived in <a href="/definition/1911">1911</a> in Chatrapur, <a href="/definition/India">India</a>. His father, Julius Mathison Turing, was a member of the Indian civil service. Julius and wife Ethel (<i>n√©e</i> Stoney) wanted Alan to be brought up in <a href="/definition/United_Kingdom">Britain</a>, so they returned to <a href="/definition/Paddington">Paddington</a>, <a href="/definition/London">London</a>. His father's civil service commission was still active, and during Turing's childhood years his parents travelled between <a href="/definition/Guildford">Guildford</a>, <a href="/definition/England">England</a> and <a href="/definition/India">India</a>, leaving their two sons to stay with friends in England, rather than risk their health in the British colony. Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius he was to display more prominently later. He is said to have taught himself to read in three weeks, and to have shown an early affinity for numbers and puzzles.
</p><p>His parents enrolled him at St. Michael's, a day school, at six years of age. The headmistress recognized his genius early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In <a href="/definition/1926">1926</a>, at the age of 14, he went on to the <a href="/definition/Sherborne">Sherborne</a> <a href="/definition/Boarding_school">boarding school</a> in <a href="/definition/Dorset">Dorset</a>. His first day of term coincided with a general strike in England, and so determined was he to attend his first day that he rode his bike unaccompanied over sixty miles from <a href="/definition/Southampton">Southampton</a> to school, stopping overnight at an <a href="/definition/Inn">inn</a> &mdash; a feat reported in the local press.
</p><p>Turing's natural inclination toward mathematics and science did not earn him respect with the teachers at Sherborne, a famous and expensive <a href="/definition/Public_school_%28UK%29">public school</a> (a British private school with charitable status), whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the <a href="/definition/Classics">classics</a>. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two schools. If he is to stay at Public School, he must aimed at becoming <i>educated</i>. If he is to be solely a <i>Scientific Specialist</i>, he is wasting his time at a Public School," (<i>Alan Turing: The Enigma</i> by Andrew Hodges, Walker Publishing Company edition (2000), p. 26).
</p><p>But despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in <a href="/definition/1927">1927</a> without having even studied elementary <a href="/definition/Calculus">calculus</a>. In <a href="/definition/1928">1928</a>, aged sixteen, Turing encountered <a href="/definition/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein's questioning of <a href="/definition/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Newton's laws of motion</a> from a text in which this was never made explicit.
</p><p>Turing's hopes and ambitions at school were raised by his strong feelings for his friend Christopher Morcom, with whom he fell in love, though the feeling was not reciprocated. Morcom died only a few weeks into their last term at Sherborne, from complications of <a href="/definition/Bovine">bovine</a> <a href="/definition/Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk as a boy. Turing was heart-broken.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div style="width:322px;">  <div class="thumbcaption" >The computer room at King's is now named after Turing, who became a student there in 1931 and a Fellow in 1935.</div></div></div>
<a name="College_and_his_work_on_computability"></a><h2> College and his work on computability </h2>
<p>Due to his unwillingness to work as hard on his classical studies as on science and mathematics, Turing failed to win a scholarship to <a href="/definition/Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, and went on to the college of his second choice, <a href="/definition/King%27s_College">King's College</a>. He studied under <a href="/definition/G._H._Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a>, a respected mathematician, who held the <a href="/definition/Sadleirian_Chair">Sadleirian Chair</a> at Cambridge, then a center for mathematical research and study, from <a href="/definition/1931">1931</a> to <a href="/definition/1934">1934</a>. In <a href="/definition/1935">1935</a> he was elected a Fellow at King's College. Hardy was a member of the infamous <a href="/definition/Cambridge_Apostles">Cambridge Apostles</a>, which gained notoriety during this period from the <a href="/definition/Cambridge_Five">Cambridge Spy Ring</a> scandal. Oddly, but perhaps the better for him, Turing was either not invited to join the circle, or declined the invitation.
</p><p>In his momentous paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" (submitted on <a href="/definition/May_28">May 28</a>, <a href="/definition/1936">1936</a>), Turing reformulated <a href="/definition/Kurt_G%F6del">Kurt G√∂del</a>'s <a href="/definition/1931">1931</a> results on the limits of proof and computation, substituting G√∂del's universal arithmetics-based formal language by what are now called <a href="/definition/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>, formal and simple devices. He proved that such a machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical problem if it were representable as an <a href="/definition/Algorithm">algorithm</a>, even if no actual Turing machine would be likely to have practical applications, being much slower than alternatives. Turing machines are to this day the central object of study in <a href="/definition/Computation">theory of computation</a>. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the <i><a href="/definition/Entscheidungsproblem">Entscheidungsproblem</a></i> by first showing that the <a href="/definition/Halting_problem">halting problem</a> for Turing machines is uncomputable: it is not possible to algorithmically decide whether a given Turing machine will ever halt. While his proof was published subsequent to <a href="/definition/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>'s equivalent proof in respect to his <a href="/definition/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, Turing's work is considerably more accessible and intuitive. It was also novel in its notion of a "Universal (Turing) Machine," the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine. The paper also introduces the notion of <a href="/definition/Definable_number">definable numbers</a>.
</p><p>Most of <a href="/definition/1937">1937</a> and <a href="/definition/1938">1938</a> he spent at <a href="/definition/Princeton_University">Princeton University</a>, studying under Alonzo Church. In <a href="/definition/1938">1938</a> he obtained his <a href="/definition/Doctor_of_Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> from Princeton; his dissertation introduced the notion of <a href="/definition/Hypercomputation">hypercomputation</a> where Turing machines are augmented with so-called <a href="/definition/Oracle_machine">oracles</a>, allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved algorithmically.
</p><p>Back in Cambridge in 1939, he attended lectures by <a href="/definition/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> about the <a href="/definition/Foundations_of_mathematics">foundations of mathematics</a>. The two argued and disagreed vehemently, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein arguing that mathematics is overvalued and does not discover any absolute truths.

<div class="thumb tright"><div style="width:302px;">  <div class="thumbcaption" >Replica of a bombe machine</div></div></div>
<p>During <a href="/definition/World_War_II">World War II</a> he was a major participant in the efforts at <a href="/definition/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley Park</a> to break German ciphers. Turing's codebreaking work was kept secret until the <a href="/definition/1970s">1970s</a>; not even his close friends knew about it. He contributed several insights into breaking both the <a href="/definition/Enigma_machine">Enigma machine</a> and the <a href="/definition/Lorenz_SZ_40/42">Lorenz SZ 40/42</a> (a teletype cipher attachment codenamed "Tunny" by the British).
</p><p>To help crack the <a href="/definition/Enigma_machine">Enigma machine</a>, Turing came up with the logical idea behind the <a href="/definition/Bombe">bombe</a>, an electromechanical machine &mdash; named after the Polish-designed <i><a href="/definition/Bomba_%28cryptography%29">bomba</a></i> &mdash; which could be used to eliminate large numbers of candidate Enigma settings. Turing's bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, was the primary tool used by Allied codebreakers to read Enigma traffic, with over 200 bombes in operation by the end of the war. For each possible setting, a chain of logical deductions was implemented electrically, and it was possible to detect when a contradiction had occurred and rule out that setting. The design and production of the machine itself was undertaken by <a href="/definition/Harold_Keen">Harold Keen</a> of the British Tabulating Machine company. For a time, Turing was head of Hut 8, the section responsible for cryptanalysing German Naval signals. He invented the technique of Banburisumus.
</p><p>Turing devised some methods for attacking Tunny, termed <i>Turingismus</i> or <i>Turingery</i>, although other methods were also used. To assist in the codebreaking, the first digital programmable electronic <a href="/definition/Computer">computer</a> was developed, <a href="/definition/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>. Turing, however, was not directly involved &mdash; Colossus was designed and built at the Post Office Research Station at <a href="/definition/Dollis_Hill">Dollis Hill</a> by a team led by <a href="/definition/Thomas_Flowers">Thomas Flowers</a> in <a href="/definition/1943">1943</a>.

<p>From <a href="/definition/1945">1945</a> to <a href="/definition/1948">1948</a> he was at the <a href="/definition/National_Physical_Laboratory">National Physical Laboratory</a>, where he worked on the design of ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). In <a href="/definition/1949">1949</a> he became deputy director of the computing laboratory at the <a href="/definition/University_of_Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, and worked on software for one of the earliest true computers &mdash; the <a href="/definition/Manchester_Mark_I">Manchester Mark I</a>. During this time he continued to do more abstract work, and in "<a href="/definition/Computing_machinery_and_intelligence">Computing machinery and intelligence</a>" (Mind, October <a href="/definition/1950">1950</a>), Turing tackled the problem of <a href="/definition/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, and proposed an experiment now known as the <a href="/definition/Turing_test">Turing test</a>, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "sentient".
</p><p>In the <a href="/definition/1940s">1940s</a>, Turing began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist.  In <a href="/definition/1952">1952</a>, lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded; the program lost to a colleague of Turing.
</p>
<a name="Work_on_pattern_formation_and_mathematical_biology"></a><h2> Work on pattern formation and mathematical biology </h2>
<p>Turing worked from 1952 until his death in 1954 on <a href="/definition/Mathematical_biology">mathematical biology</a>, specifically <a href="/definition/Morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a>. He published one paper on the subject called "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in 1952. His central interest in the field was understanding <a href="/definition/Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> phyllotaxis, the existence of <a href="/definition/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci numbers</a> in plant structures. He used reaction-diffusion equations which are now central to the field of pattern formation. Later papers went unpublished until 1992 when <i>Collected Works of A.M. Turing</i> was published.

<p>Prosecution of Turing for his <a href="/definition/Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> crippled his career. In <a href="/definition/1952">1952</a>, his male lover helped an accomplice to break into Turing's house and commit <a href="/definition/Larceny">larceny</a>. Turing went to the police to report the crime. As a result of the police investigation, Turing was said to have had a sexual relationship with a 19-year-old man, and charged with "gross indecency and sexual perversion." He unapologetically offered no defence, and was convicted. Following the well-publicised trial, he was given a choice between incarceration and <a href="/definition/Libido">libido</a>-reducing <a href="/definition/Hormone">hormonal</a> <a href="/definition/Chemical_castration">treatment</a>. He chose the <a href="/definition/Estrogen">oestrogen</a> hormone injections, which lasted for a year, with side effects including the <a href="/definition/Gynecomastia">development of breasts</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/definition/1954">1954</a>, he died of <a href="/definition/Cyanide">cyanide</a> <a href="/definition/Poisoning">poisoning</a>, apparently from a cyanide-laced apple he left half-eaten. Most believe that his death was intentional, and the death was ruled a <a href="/definition/Suicide">suicide</a>. His mother, however, strenuously argued that the ingestion was accidental due to his careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Friends of his have said that Turing may have killed himself in this ambiguous way quite deliberately, to give his mother some plausible deniability.
