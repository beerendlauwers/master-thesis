                   ri

'Given the formulae f0, f1, ..., fn, formula g can be deduced with rule ri'


set of theorems Ts

Contains all formulae that can be deduced from the empty set:

|----- f
   s

Also called simply a deduction. Consists of a string of formulae that contains only axioms and derived formulae that have been deduced like in page 40 (c).

A system S is ..... if ....

coherent	    it has well-formed formulae that are not theorems.

consistent /	    it includes a symbol for negation and there are no well-formed formulae where f and 
non-contradictory   (not f) are both theorems. If this is not the case, it is INCONSISTENT or 
		    SELF-CONTRADICTORY.

categorical	    it includes a symbol for negation and for every well-formed formulae either f or
                    (not f) is a member of Ts.

saturated	    for all formulae f, adding f to the axioms of S makes it inconsistent.

axioms of a system are INDEPENDENT if the removal of any axiom results in a formal system having fewer theorems than S.

the DECISION PROBLEM for S is the problem of finding whether or not Ts is recursive, that is, finding whether or not the predicate P(t): t is a theorem of S is decidable. If Ts is recursive, the system is said to be DECIDABLE.

finitely axiomatizable if As is finite or if there is a system with the same alphabet, well-formed formulae, inference rules and theorems with a finite set of axioms.
