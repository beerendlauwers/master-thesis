* Team members

Gabe Dijkstra and Hidde Verstoep.

* GHC version

The code has been tested with ghc version 7.0.3.

* Build instructions

Run "make". Note that we did include the files generated by
UUAGC. This is because cabal would complain otherwise when creating
the source tarball. You might want to do a "make clean" first, to also
generate the Haskell code.

* Running the program

You can use the "run" script to see how you can run the
program. "runall" will run all the example files. Look at
"examples/report.txt" to see whether the outcome is supposed to be an
error or not.

* Location of interesting code

The important code, i.e. typechecking and creation of the Picture, can
be found in "src/CCO/Diag/AG/Typecheck.ag" and
"src/CCO/Diag/AG/TDiag2Picture.ag", respectively.

* Extra functionality implemented

 - let bindings, look at examples/12.tdiag

* Documentation

The design documentation can be found in "Design.pdf".
