Development on Yesod started in 2009. It has quickly grown into a mature web framework featuring tightly integrated web framework capabilities. 
Yesod  is the only web framework in the comparison that natively supports internationalization and the only one that started without an in--house web server component.
This changed in 2011, when development on the $ warp $ web server package commenced.
