Haskell--based web frameworks are a recent concept.
HAppS was one of the first Haskell web frameworks available, and was announced publicly in 2005. Development continued until November 2008, after which Happstack forked off of HAppS.
Happstack's oldest version on Hackage stems from March 2009, and Yesod's and Snap's first versions were available on Hackage on March 2010 and December 2010, respectively.
All three frameworks have grown at a high rate and have become fully--featured web frameworks.
Many independent web--based libraries continue to originate and be maintained, making the choice for a web framework written in Haskell all the more attractive.
