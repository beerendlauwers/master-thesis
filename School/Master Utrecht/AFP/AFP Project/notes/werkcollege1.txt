Augusto and Frank had a talk with Doaitse about project.

Information about the project
-----------------------------
This project was done last year by HBO students.
They looked at it on a practical view.
They implemented a websystem in Happstack, Yesod and Snap.
We get access to their source/paper.

If we were to compare these we should look at technical/theoretical aspects.
Like typesystem usage and error handeling.

iTask in Clean
--------------
Developed in Nijmegen.
iTask is a dynamic flow system using a sense of state.
Clean allows to store partial computations.
Haskell Ghci7.2 allows to save things in the cloud.
It might be possible to work iTask in to Haskell.

Using a state architecture instread of a stateless architecture has pros/cons.
Is it possible to compare statefull vs stateless architectures?
Lets look into this and see if we can compare the solutions for the web framework problems instead of comparing 'stateless webframeworks'.
