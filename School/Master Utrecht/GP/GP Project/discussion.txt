Initial paper:

http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/Alexey/ComparingLibrariesForGenericProgrammingInHaskell

 - Benchmarking

Find libraries on hackage


 - Libraries

All libraries have been uploaded into the SVN repository. Now we need to fill in the benchmarkings for every library.

- TeX and others go into doc

Remark on TeX, is it possible to hold version control inside a tex file? i would like to see inside the tex when somebody edited it.




COPIED FROM lib/discussion.txt:

The folder structure should be used to hold the latest, and working versions of the libraries, furthermore there is the indication which libraries we are going to compare.

I think it is good to add some information about which library is working etc.
