- Doesn't seem to support GMap because mapFamily expects an Identity functor, so it will reject any function that changes the types

- Doesn't seem to support support generic functions (in the sense of, say, EMGM's CrushRight functions) because there is no representation plate that data types could be converted to

- Does support generic traversal of a plate

- Does support collection of values in a structure

- Does support updating values in a structure, but they have to remain the same type

- It is interesting to see how similar plate construction is for different functions, automatic construction of boilerplate code for a certain data type using the data type and a meta-description of the generic function might be worth looking into for someone else

- Doesn't seem to support nested datatypes
