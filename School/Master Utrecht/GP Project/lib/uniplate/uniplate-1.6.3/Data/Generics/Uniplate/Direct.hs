    This module supplies a method for writing 'Uniplate' and 'Biplate' instances.
    This moulde gives the highest performance, but requires many instance definitions. The
    instances can be generated using Derive: <http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/derive/>.
    
    To take an example:
    
    > data Expr = Var Int | Pos Expr String | Neg Expr | Add Expr Expr
    > data Stmt = Seq [Stmt] | Sel [Expr] | Let String Expr
    >
    > instance Uniplate Expr where
    >     uniplate (Var x  ) = plate Var |- x
    >     uniplate (Pos x y) = plate Pos |* x |- y
    >     uniplate (Neg x  ) = plate Neg |* x
    >     uniplate (Add x y) = plate Add |* x |* y
    >
    > instance Biplate Expr Expr where
    >     biplate = plateSelf
    >
    > instance Uniplate Stmt where
    >     uniplate (Seq x  ) = plate Seq ||* x
    >     uniplate (Sel x  ) = plate Sel ||+ x
    >     uniplate (Let x y) = plate Let |-  x |- y
    >
    > instance Biplate Stmt Stmt where
    >     biplate = plateSelf
    >
    > instance Biplate Stmt Expr where
    >     biplate (Seq x  ) = plate Seq ||+ x
    >     biplate (Sel x  ) = plate Sel ||* x
    >     biplate (Let x y) = plate Let |-  x |* y

-- | Write an instance in terms of a projection/injection pair. Usually used to define instances
--   for abstract containers such as Map:
--
-- > instance Biplate (Map.Map [Char] Int) Int where
-- >     biplate = plateProject Map.toAscList Map.fromDistinctAscList
--
-- Because we know that Uniplate operations will not change the keys,
-- we can use the 'fromDistictAscList' function to reconstruct it.
